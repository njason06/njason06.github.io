        Hi Kiana, I made this website to help you learn how to play chess

        <h2>How to use your pieces cohesively</h2>
        The first step is to develop your pieces. You need to move your pieces from the bottom rank (the bottom rank is where your king is).
        This is called development, if your pieces are in the backrow they are unable to do anything. You can learn basic openings to help with development. I reccomend learning
        the London system or the Italian game. These are really beginner friendly and help you use your pieces cohesively. <br>

        <h2>How to Attack</h2>
        Attacking in Chess is pretty difficult. Somehow making your pieces work together is actually pretty hard. An easy way to get your pieces 
        to work together is creating a common goal. This could either be trying to win a piece, or attacking the king. Having your pieces work together 
        is crucial because if there isn't another piece protecting each other, the king will either be able to take or another piece will be able to take 
        with no consequences. Here is an example of using your pieces together. <br>

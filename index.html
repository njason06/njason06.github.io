        Hi Kiana, I made this website to help you learn how to play chess (i made this using html generated from an ai)
        <h2>How to use your pieces cohesively</h2>
        The first step is to develop your pieces. You need to move your pieces from the bottom rank (the bottom rank is where your king is).
        This is called development, if your pieces are in the backrow they are unable to do anything. You can learn basic openings to help with development. I reccomend learning
        the London system or the Italian game. These are really beginner friendly and help you use your pieces cohesively. <br>
        <br>
        This is the Italian setup <br>
